# FAQ / Key Questions Document

## 1. What does "AI First" mean in practice?
Our AI-first approach fundamentally changes the economics of custom software development, enabling unprecedented speed and dramatically lower costs that make previously uneconomical solutions viable. We embed AI into every stage: market research, workflow analysis, user research synthesis, workflow optimization, prototyping, UI generation, code scaffolding, QA testing, and adoption analytics. This allows us to deliver comprehensive solutions—from problem research to workflow integration—with revolutionary speed and cost efficiency that expands the range of problems that can be practically addressed.

## 2. What types of problems do you solve?
We solve business problems with SaaS software applications that were previously considered uneconomical to address. Our AI-first approach makes custom solutions viable for a much broader range of challenges. Typical problems include:
- **Workflow inefficiencies** that were too expensive to address with custom software but now have positive ROI through our approach.
- **Process bottlenecks** where people spend excessive time on manual tasks that could be streamlined with integrated software solutions.
- **Change management challenges** where new tools fail to gain adoption because they don't integrate with existing work patterns.
- **Training and learning gaps** that require workflow-integrated solutions for successful adoption.
- **Digital transformation initiatives** that need both software and workflow redesign to ensure successful implementation.
- **Previously unfeasible automation** that becomes economically viable through our revolutionary speed and cost approach.

## 3. What industries do you focus on?
We work broadly across industries but have deep expertise in:
- **Learning Technology** (corporate L&D, sales enablement)
- **IoT** (connected devices and dashboards)
- **Drones** (management, control, data visualization)
- **Financial Services** (retail trading and portfolio tools)

## 4. How do you engage with clients?
We typically start with a **Discovery & Research package** that produces a problem statement, current workflow documentation, and opportunity map. We then move through **Workflow Design** to create optimized workflows that integrate software seamlessly, followed by **Prototyping** with workflow integration and **Validation** with real workflows. From there, clients can choose:
- **Workflow and design hand-off** to internal engineering teams with comprehensive integration plans.
- **Implementation** by us, delivering pilot-ready or full SaaS solutions with workflow optimization and adoption monitoring.
- **Retainer** for ongoing workflow optimization, software iteration, and adoption support.

---

## 5. How do you price engagements?
- **Fixed Package**: Standardized discovery and prototyping.
- **Project-Based**: Defined scope and milestones.
- **Retainer**: Ongoing advisory and execution.
- **Outcome-Based**: Linked to client success metrics (e.g., validated MVP, funding raised).

---

## 6. How do you ensure quality?
We use structured user-centered design processes backed by decades of product management and workflow optimization experience. While AI accelerates delivery, human expertise ensures strategic alignment, workflow integration, usability, and business impact. We conduct iterative validation with real users testing both software functionality and workflow integration before scaling. Our approach includes workflow adoption monitoring to ensure successful integration into how people actually work, not just technical functionality.

---

## 7. What about intellectual property (IP)?
All deliverables, prototypes, and code created for your engagement belong to you. We use AI tools as accelerators, but the output is owned by the client.

---

## 8. What if my idea isn’t viable?
That’s part of the value we provide. By testing early and often with prototypes, we help you fail fast when needed and avoid costly missteps. Even when an idea doesn’t validate, clients gain clarity and can redirect resources to higher-value opportunities.

---

## 9. How scalable are your solutions?
Our prototypes can evolve into scalable SaaS applications. We use sustainable code bases when moving beyond prototypes, ensuring smooth handoff to internal teams or further build-out by us.

---

## 10. Why should we choose you over a traditional consultancy or dev shop?
- **ROI Game-Changer**: Our AI-first approach fundamentally changes the economics, making custom software viable for problems previously considered uneconomical.
- **User-Centered Workflow Design**: We don't just build software—we redesign how people work, ensuring seamless integration and higher adoption rates.
- **Revolutionary Speed & Cost**: From idea to working prototype in weeks, not months, at unprecedented cost efficiency.
- **Comprehensive methodology**: End-to-end expertise from problem research and workflow design to adoption monitoring.
- **Proven adoption success**: High adoption rates through workflow integration, not just technical delivery.
- **Domain knowledge**: Deep expertise in learning tech, IoT, drones, and finance with understanding of industry-specific workflows.
- **Flexible engagement models**: From workflow design handoffs to full implementation with adoption support.

---

## 11. How do you ensure software adoption and workflow integration?
We start by researching how people currently work and understanding their existing patterns before designing any software. We then create optimized workflows that integrate the new software seamlessly into users' daily activities. During validation, we test with real workflows, not just software functionality. Our implementation includes change management strategies and adoption monitoring to ensure successful integration. This workflow-centered approach typically results in 95%+ adoption rates because the software fits how people actually work, rather than forcing them to change their work patterns to fit the software.

---

## 12. What if our problem seems too small or unique for custom software?
This is exactly the type of challenge our AI-first approach addresses. Problems that were previously considered too small, too unique, or too expensive for custom software solutions are now economically viable through our revolutionary speed and cost approach. We specialize in making previously uneconomical solutions work by fundamentally changing the ROI calculation. Many of our most successful projects started as "small" problems that traditional approaches couldn't justify addressing.
