# Simple Business Plan

## Executive Summary
Our AI-first product development consultancy empowers organizations to solve business problems with SaaS software applications through unprecedented speed and dramatically lower costs, fundamentally changing ROI calculations and expanding the range of problems that can be practically addressed with custom software solutions. 

We combine user-centered design methodology with AI-powered execution, starting by researching problems, understanding how people work, designing optimized workflows that integrate new tools, then creating and iterating solutions based on evolving workflow understanding. Clients benefit from revolutionary speed-to-market, seamless workflow integration, higher adoption rates, and cost-effective delivery that makes previously uneconomical solutions viable.

## Market Opportunity
- **Organizations with workflow inefficiencies**: Businesses facing process bottlenecks that were previously too expensive to address with custom software solutions.
- **AI-curious organizations**: Businesses intrigued by AI but without internal expertise to leverage it for problem-solving.
- **Mid-market enterprises**: Companies with innovation mandates but limited product teams, now able to address a broader range of problems due to changed ROI economics.
- **Startups**: Early-stage teams needing validated concepts, MVPs, and pilots to secure funding, with access to previously unaffordable custom solutions.
- **Domain-specific niches**: Learning technology, IoT, drones, and financial services where founder-level expertise adds credibility and deep workflow understanding.

Market trends show increasing demand for rapid experimentation with AI-driven SaaS applications, while our AI-first approach fundamentally changes what's economically viable. Few service providers combine user-centered workflow design, product strategy expertise, and AI-enabled execution to make custom software solutions accessible to problems that were previously considered uneconomical to address.

## Services & Offerings
1. **Discovery & Research**: Deep problem understanding through user research, workflow analysis, and JTBD frameworks. We study how people currently work and identify pain points that software can address.
2. **Workflow Design**: Create new, optimized workflows that integrate the proposed software solution seamlessly into users' existing work patterns and processes.
3. **Prototyping**: Rapid, multi-fidelity prototypes using AI-accelerated development with Bubble, Coda, and custom code to bring workflow visions to life.
4. **Validation & Iteration**: User testing with real workflows, gathering feedback, and iterating both the software and workflow design as understanding evolves.
5. **Implementation**: Flexible options from design handoff to Early Operating Capability, Initial Operating Capability, or full Release with ongoing workflow optimization.
6. **Sustainment**: Monitoring workflow adoption, optimization based on usage patterns, and planned transition.

## Revenue Model
- **Project-Based Fees**: Pricing tied to deliverables and milestones.
- **Fixed Packages**: Standardized discovery + prototype engagements.
- **Retainers**: Ongoing advisory and iterative development.
- **Outcome-Based Pricing**: Tied to funding milestones or adoption metrics (select clients).

---

## Financial Projections (Lean Startup Approach)
- **Year 1**: Focus on establishing pipeline, securing 3–5 pilot clients, generating $250K–$500K revenue.
- **Year 2**: Expand to additional verticals, grow retainer base, target $1M revenue.
- **Year 3**: Scale delivery capacity (human + AI), pursue larger enterprise clients, target $2M+ revenue.

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Market Education**: Clients may not understand AI-first methods → Mitigation: provide clear case studies and transparent process.
- **Dependence on AI Tools**: Risk of platform changes → Mitigation: diversify AI tooling and maintain internal frameworks.
- **Capacity Limits**: Single founder bottleneck → Mitigation: leverage AI for scale and selectively add human collaborators.
- **Client Adoption Risk**: Early SaaS ideas may fail validation → Mitigation: embrace iterative validation to minimize sunk cost.
