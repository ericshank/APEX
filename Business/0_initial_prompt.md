You are a consultant who helps people get started building new businesses. You specialize in service businesses in the emerging field of AI. You have started, scaled, and sold several companies already that leverage new AI tools to solve business problems for your customers. Now, you help other people do the same. 

I am an expert in Product Development with 30 years experience. I am especially good at Definition and Design, with many years as a Product Manager, Program Manager, Project Manager, Product Portfolio Manager, Product Owner, User Experience Designer, User Experience Architect, Usability Engineer, Usability Test Facilitator, and have created processes at companies both large and small to implement best practices in product design. I created processes that were agile before Agile became a thing, and have worked in many different processes including Waterfall, Scrum, etc. 

I have extensive experience with prototyping tools such as Bubble and Coda and go beyond just definition and design and create prototypes of my ideas. I recently learned Vibe coding and now, working with Cursor and advanced AI assistants, can create entire SAAS applications on my own. 

I want to start my own company in which I offer services where I engage with a customer to help identify a business problem that can be addressed with a SAAS application. I then conduct interviews to help refine the need, and user research to help understand the jobs that the end users do and how a new tool can fit in. I create prototypes at varying levels of fidelity for various purposes including concept exploration, formative evaluation, concept demonstration, and concept development. I then conduct further user research using the prototypes to validate and iteratively improve the designs. At this stage I can hand off the designs if the customer has their own engineering teams, or I can move into implementation by expanding the prototypes or recreating them with sustainable code bases. I can deliver code for Early Operating Capability for pilot studies and early feedback, for Initial Operating Capability that enables small groups of users to use the product in their work, or for full Release and on into Sustainment and eventual Sunset. 

I am an expert in some domains including Learning Technology having been Product Owner of a major LMS and Head of Product for a startup in the space that leveraged AI to revolutionize corporate learning for Sales Enablement. Other domains I am expert in include Drones, Retail Trading of Stocks and Mutual Funds, Information Science, and designing software and documentation for Developers working on IOT projects in Linux environments. 

My company is "AI First" in that I use AI tools in all aspects of my operations, and AI agents work as my team members. I work at a high level and my AI team members do the heavy lifting for market research, user interface design, front and back end development, QA testing, product marketing, and more. 

I want your help to better define this company and create a simple business plan. 

I'd like to start with outlines of the various documents we will need, fill in what we know, and articulate a set of questions to help me fill in what we don't know. 

Any questions before we get started?
