# FAQ / Key Questions Document

## 1. What does "AI First" mean in practice?
We embed AI into every stage of the process. AI agents assist with market research, user research synthesis, prototyping, UI generation, code scaffolding, QA testing, and analytics. This allows us to operate lean and fast, delivering results with the efficiency of a much larger team.

---

## 2. What types of problems do you solve?
We help identify business problems that can be addressed with SaaS applications, then design and validate solutions. Typical challenges include:
- Inefficient workflows that can be automated.
- Training or learning gaps that can be addressed with AI-driven tools.
- Need for rapid validation of new concepts before scaling.
- Digital transformation initiatives requiring modern SaaS tools.

---

## 3. What industries do you focus on?
We work broadly across industries but have deep expertise in:
- **Learning Technology** (corporate L&D, sales enablement)
- **IoT** (connected devices and dashboards)
- **Drones** (management, control, data visualization)
- **Financial Services** (retail trading and portfolio tools)

---

## 4. How do you engage with clients?
We typically start with a **Discovery & Research package** (e.g., 6-week engagement) that produces a problem statement, opportunity map, and prototypes. From there, clients can choose:
- **Design hand-off** to internal engineering teams.
- **Implementation** by us, delivering pilot-ready or full SaaS solutions.
- **Retainer** for ongoing innovation and iteration.

---

## 5. How do you price engagements?
- **Fixed Package**: Standardized discovery and prototyping.
- **Project-Based**: Defined scope and milestones.
- **Retainer**: Ongoing advisory and execution.
- **Outcome-Based**: Linked to client success metrics (e.g., validated MVP, funding raised).

---

## 6. How do you ensure quality?
We use structured design processes backed by decades of product management experience. AI accelerates delivery, but human expertise ensures strategic alignment, usability, and business impact. We conduct iterative validation with real users before scaling.

---

## 7. What about intellectual property (IP)?
All deliverables, prototypes, and code created for your engagement belong to you. We use AI tools as accelerators, but the output is owned by the client.

---

## 8. What if my idea isn’t viable?
That’s part of the value we provide. By testing early and often with prototypes, we help you fail fast when needed and avoid costly missteps. Even when an idea doesn’t validate, clients gain clarity and can redirect resources to higher-value opportunities.

---

## 9. How scalable are your solutions?
Our prototypes can evolve into scalable SaaS applications. We use sustainable code bases when moving beyond prototypes, ensuring smooth handoff to internal teams or further build-out by us.

---

## 10. Why should we choose you over a traditional consultancy or dev shop?
- Faster, leaner delivery using AI.
- Expertise across the full product lifecycle.
- Transparent process that shows how AI accelerates outcomes.
- Domain knowledge in learning tech, IoT, drones, and finance.
- Flexible engagement models to fit your needs.
