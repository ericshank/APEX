# AI Prompt Guide – Using the Master Context

This guide explains how to work with AI assistants using the **Master Context Document** so responses stay aligned with the business vision, services, and strategy.

---

## How to Use the Master Context
- **Attach the Master Context Document** to prompts when asking for business planning help.  
- The assistant will then have a high-level overview of the company plus references to detailed supporting docs.  
- This avoids repeating background details every time.

## Prompting Tips

### 1. Strategic Planning
- *“Using the Master Context, help me refine the GTM strategy for mid-sized businesses in the learning tech space.”*
- *“Compare different pricing approaches for our services—fixed package vs. retainer—given our AI-first positioning.”*

### 2. Document Expansion
- *“Expand the Simple Business Plan with more detail on risks and mitigations, using the Master Context for consistency.”*
- *“Draft a Website Content Plan that aligns with the services described in the Master Context.”*

### 3. Client-Facing Materials
- *“Create a client onboarding guide consistent with the Services & Engagement Model in the Master Context.”*
- *“Write a case study template I can reuse, referencing the examples in the Case Study Document.”*

### 4. Branding & Positioning
- *“Suggest tagline variations for Clearframe, ensuring they align with the Differentiators in the Master Context.”*
- *“Develop LinkedIn post ideas that highlight our AI First positioning.”*

### 5. Operational Planning
- *“Help me outline an AI Tooling Guide that explains how we use AI at each phase of delivery.”*
- *“Draft a Process Playbook section for Discovery & Research, ensuring it connects to our core services.”*

## Best Practices
- **Be Specific**: Point to which part of the Master Context or supporting docs you want to focus on.
- **Iterate**: Start broad, then ask for refinements or expansions.
- **Stay Consistent**: Reuse terminology from the Master Context (e.g., “Early Operating Capability,” “AI First”).
- **Highlight Audience**: Indicate whether content is for clients, investors, or internal use.

## When to Update the Master Context
- When services change.  
- When new documents are added (e.g., Website Content Plan, Client Onboarding Pack).  
- When branding decisions (like name or tagline) are finalized.  

Keeping the Master Context current ensures all future AI-assisted work stays aligned.
