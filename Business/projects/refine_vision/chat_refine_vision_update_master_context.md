**User**

I want your help to make any necessary changes to @0_MASTER_CONTEXT.md based on @0_refinement_prompts.md 

---

**Cursor**

I'll analyze the refinement prompt and update the Master Context document to better articulate the business purpose and approach. Let me examine both documents and make the necessary changes.

Based on the refinement prompt, I need to make several key updates to the Master Context document:

1. **Reframe the mission** to emphasize solving business problems with SaaS applications
2. **Highlight the AI-first advantage** in terms of speed and cost that changes ROI calculations
3. **Expand the user-centered design approach** that starts with problem research and workflow design
4. **Emphasize the iterative methodology** with feedback loops

Let me update the Master Context document:

# FAQ / Key Questions Document

## 1. What does "AI First" mean in practice?
Our AI-first approach fundamentally changes the economics of custom software development, enabling unprecedented speed and dramatically lower costs that make previously uneconomical solutions viable. We embed AI into every stage: market research, workflow analysis, user research synthesis, workflow optimization, prototyping, UI generation, code scaffolding, QA testing, and adoption analytics. This allows us to deliver comprehensive solutions—from problem research to workflow integration—with revolutionary speed and cost efficiency that expands the range of problems that can be practically addressed.

---

## 2. What types of problems do you solve?
We help identify business problems that can be addressed with SaaS applications, then design and validate solutions. Typical challenges include:
- Inefficient workflows that can be automated.
- Training or learning gaps that can be addressed with AI-driven tools.
- Need for rapid validation of new concepts before scaling.
- Digital transformation initiatives requiring modern SaaS tools.
