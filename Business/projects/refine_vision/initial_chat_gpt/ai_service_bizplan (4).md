# Simple Business Plan

## Executive Summary
Our consultancy helps organizations identify real business problems that can be solved with SaaS applications, and rapidly move from idea to operational capability using AI-first methods. Combining decades of product leadership experience with AI-powered execution, we deliver discovery, research, prototyping, validation, and implementation services. Clients benefit from faster time-to-market, reduced risk, and cost-effective delivery.

## Market Opportunity
- **AI-curious organizations**: Businesses intrigued by AI but without internal expertise.
- **Mid-market enterprises**: Especially those with innovation mandates but limited product teams.
- **Startups**: Early-stage teams needing validated concepts, MVPs, and pilots to secure funding.
- **Domain-specific niches**: Learning technology, IoT, drones, and financial services where founder-level expertise adds credibility and insight.

Market trends show increasing demand for rapid experimentation with AI-driven SaaS applications, but few service providers combine product strategy, design expertise, and AI-enabled execution into one offering.

2. **Prototyping**: Rapid prototypes from sketches to functional demos.
3. **Validation**: User testing and iterative design improvement.
4. **Implementation**: Flexible options from design handoff to Early Operating Capability, Initial Operating Capability, or full Release.
5. **Sustainment**: Optimization, monitoring, and planned sunset.

## Go-to-Market Strategy
- **Thought Leadership**: Publish articles, case studies, and insights on AI-first product development.
- **Networking**: Leverage professional connections and conferences in learning tech, SaaS, and AI innovation.
- **Pilot Programs**: Offer initial engagements as packaged services (e.g., 6-week discovery + prototype).
- **Partnerships**: Collaborate with design agencies, consultancies, and accelerators to provide AI-first services.

---

## Operating Model
- **Human-AI Teaming**: The founder operates as lead strategist and product expert, with AI agents handling market research, design drafts, code generation, QA, and analytics.
- **Scalable Delivery**: AI agents increase throughput, allowing lean operations while serving multiple clients.
- **Flexible Collaboration**: Capable of both client team augmentation and end-to-end project ownership.

---

## Revenue Model
- **Project-Based Fees**: Pricing tied to deliverables and milestones.
- **Fixed Packages**: Standardized discovery + prototype engagements.
- **Retainers**: Ongoing advisory and iterative development.
- **Outcome-Based Pricing**: Tied to funding milestones or adoption metrics (select clients).

---

## Financial Projections (Lean Startup Approach)
- **Year 1**: Focus on establishing pipeline, securing 3–5 pilot clients, generating $250K–$500K revenue.
- **Year 2**: Expand to additional verticals, grow retainer base, target $1M revenue.
- **Year 3**: Scale delivery capacity (human + AI), pursue larger enterprise clients, target $2M+ revenue.

---

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Market Education**: Clients may not understand AI-first methods → Mitigation: provide clear case studies and transparent process.
- **Dependence on AI Tools**: Risk of platform changes → Mitigation: diversify AI tooling and maintain internal frameworks.
- **Capacity Limits**: Single founder bottleneck → Mitigation: leverage AI for scale and selectively add human collaborators.
- **Client Adoption Risk**: Early SaaS ideas may fail validation → Mitigation: embrace iterative validation to minimize sunk cost.
