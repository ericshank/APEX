Rewrite this to articulate that our purpose is to empower organizations to solve business problems with SAAS software applications, with some key aspects: because we are AI first we can create these apps at a speed and low cost that have previously been unimaginable which expands the range of problems that can be addressed as the ROI calculation changes significantly.  Also, we are experts in user centered design and we start by researching the problem, understanding the work that is done by the people involved, designing a new workflow for these people that will integrate the new tool, and then creating the tool to support that vision and iterating it with feedback as the understanding of the workflow evolves.
