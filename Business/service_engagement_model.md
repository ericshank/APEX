# Services & Engagement Model

## Engagement Phases

### 1. Discovery & Research
- **Activities**: Deep problem understanding through stakeholder interviews, workflow analysis, context mapping, market research, competitor scan, Jobs-to-Be-Done analysis. Study how people currently work and identify pain points that software can address.
- **Deliverables**: Problem statement, current workflow documentation, opportunity map, prioritized use cases.
- **AI Role**: Research synthesis, thematic analysis, workflow pattern identification, opportunity assessment.

### 2. User Research & Concept Exploration
- **Activities**: User interviews, surveys, task analysis, detailed workflow mapping, understanding current work patterns.
- **Deliverables**: Personas, journey maps, JTBD profiles, detailed workflow documentation, early concept sketches.
- **AI Role**: Summarizing insights, clustering feedback, generating personas & hypotheses, workflow analysis.

### 3. Workflow Design
- **Activities**: Create new, optimized workflows that integrate the proposed software solution seamlessly into users' existing work patterns and processes. Design adoption strategies and change management approaches.
- **Deliverables**: Redesigned workflow documentation, integration points, adoption strategy, change management plan.
- **AI Role**: Workflow optimization modeling, integration scenario generation, adoption pattern analysis.

### 4. Prototyping
- **Activities**: Rapid, multi-fidelity prototypes using AI-accelerated development with Bubble, Coda, Figma, or custom code to bring workflow visions to life. Exploration of multiple concepts with workflow integration.
- **Deliverables**: Prototypes at varying fidelities with workflow integration (wireframes, clickable demos, functional prototypes).
- **AI Role**: UI generation, design variations, code scaffolding, workflow-integrated demonstrations.

### 5. Validation & Iteration
- **Activities**: User testing with real workflows, gathering feedback, and iterating both the software and workflow design as understanding evolves. Stakeholder workshops and formative evaluation.
- **Deliverables**: Workflow usability reports, validated prototypes, iteration recommendations, refined workflow designs.
- **AI Role**: Automated test analysis, workflow pattern detection, sentiment analysis, adoption prediction.

### 6. Implementation
- **Options**:
  - **Design & Workflow Handoff**: Complete documentation, assets, and workflow integration plans for client's dev team.
  - **Build-Out**: AI-assisted coding to deliver:
    - Early Operating Capability (pilot with workflow optimization)
    - Initial Operating Capability (small group use with adoption monitoring)
    - Full Release (scalable product with workflow integration)
- **AI Role**: Backend/frontend code generation, workflow automation, test automation, deployment support.

### 7. Sustainment & Sunset
- **Activities**: Monitoring workflow adoption, optimization based on usage patterns, feature enhancement, maintenance, and transition planning.
- **Deliverables**: Adoption reports, workflow optimization recommendations, performance analytics, roadmaps, transition plans.
- **AI Role**: Workflow adoption analytics, usage pattern analysis, predictive optimization, automated monitoring.

## Differentiators in Engagement
- **ROI Game-Changer**: AI-first approach enables unprecedented speed and dramatically lower costs, making custom SaaS solutions viable for problems previously considered uneconomical.
- **User-Centered Workflow Design**: We don't just build softwareâ€”we redesign how people work, ensuring seamless integration and higher adoption rates.
- **Revolutionary Speed & Cost**: From idea to working prototype in weeks, not months, at costs previously unimaginable.
- **Comprehensive Methodology**: End-to-end process from problem research and workflow design to adoption monitoring and optimization.
- **Flexible Outcomes**: From workflow design handoff to pilot-ready SaaS with integrated workflow optimization.
- **Transparent AI Integration**: Clients see how AI accelerates research, workflow design, development, and adoption monitoring.
