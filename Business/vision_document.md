# Company Definition / Vision Document

## Purpose & Mission
Our purpose is to empower organizations to solve business problems with SaaS software applications through unprecedented speed and dramatically lower costs that fundamentally change ROI calculations and expand the range of problems that can be practically addressed with custom software solutions.

Our AI-first approach enables us to create these applications at a speed and cost that have previously been unimaginable, making custom SaaS solutions viable for problems that were formerly considered uneconomical to address. This economic transformation opens up vast new opportunities for organizations to optimize their operations and workflows.

We are experts in user-centered design methodology. Our process begins with researching the problem and understanding the work that is done by the people involved. We then design new workflows for these people that will integrate the new tool seamlessly into their existing work patterns and processes. Finally, we create the tool to support that workflow vision and iterate it with feedback as our understanding of the workflow evolves, ensuring both the software and workflows are continuously optimized for maximum adoption and value.

## Problem Statement
Organizations across industries face workflow inefficiencies and business problems that could be solved with custom SaaS applications, but historically, the cost and time required made such solutions uneconomical for all but the largest problems. Many organizations are also intrigued by AI but lack the expertise to:

- Identify business problems where custom SaaS solutions could provide measurable value and ROI.
- Understand current workflows and design optimized alternatives that integrate new tools.
- Conduct effective user research and workflow analysis to ensure successful adoption.
- Rapidly validate both software solutions and workflow changes before committing resources.
- Build lean but functional applications that integrate seamlessly into existing work patterns.
- Design change management strategies that ensure successful workflow adoption.

They need a partner who can bridge problem understanding, workflow design, and software execution—making previously uneconomical solutions viable through AI-first development while ensuring successful integration into how people actually work.
