# Case Study Examples

## Case Study 1: Learning Technology – AI-Driven Sales Enablement with Workflow Integration
**Client Context**: A corporate L&D team needed to improve sales training effectiveness while integrating seamlessly into existing onboarding workflows.  
**Challenge**: Traditional LMS-driven modules were failing to build practical selling skills and had low adoption due to poor integration with sales team workflows.  
**Workflow Research**: Studied how sales managers conducted onboarding and how new reps learned on the job to understand existing work patterns.  
**Solution**: Designed optimized onboarding workflows that integrated an AI-driven roleplay platform into managers' existing processes, allowing learners to practice live conversations with AI actors, receive automated feedback, and track competency growth within their normal workflow.  
**Outcome**: Pilot validated within 8 weeks with 95% user adoption rate, leading to 40% faster onboarding of new sales reps, measurable increase in close rates, and seamless integration into existing management workflows.

## Case Study 2: IoT – Operations Dashboard with Workflow Integration  
**Client Context**: A mid-sized IoT manufacturer needed a dashboard that integrated seamlessly into existing maintenance workflows rather than creating additional systems.  
**Challenge**: Customers had functional monitoring needs, but previous dashboard solutions failed adoption because they didn't fit maintenance technicians' existing work patterns and required separate logins/processes.  
**Workflow Research**: Studied maintenance team workflows, understanding how technicians currently diagnosed issues, scheduled repairs, and documented work to identify integration points.  
**Solution**: Designed optimized maintenance workflows that embedded device monitoring directly into existing processes, created prototypes in Bubble that integrated with their current systems, and validated with real maintenance scenarios.  
**Outcome**: Delivered Initial Operating Capability in 12 weeks with seamless workflow integration, achieving 100% technician adoption, 25% reduced device downtime, and 6-month ROI that made the previously considered "nice-to-have" dashboard economically justified.

## Case Study 3: Drones – Fleet Management with Workflow Transformation
**Client Context**: A drone services company managing aerial inspections needed to transform their planning workflows while maintaining pilot familiarity and safety protocols.  
**Challenge**: Existing workflow relied on spreadsheets and manual tracking, but pilots were resistant to change due to safety concerns and established habits. Previous software attempts failed due to poor workflow integration.  
**Workflow Research**: Shadowed pilots through complete mission cycles—pre-flight planning, field operations, post-flight reporting—to understand critical workflow dependencies and safety requirements.  
**Solution**: Redesigned mission planning workflows that preserved essential safety steps while eliminating redundancy, then built a SaaS platform that integrated seamlessly into the new optimized workflow rather than forcing pilots to adapt to generic software patterns.  
**Outcome**: Within 10 weeks, achieved 100% pilot adoption in live operations with 60% planning time reduction, maintained safety compliance, and transformed previously manual processes into streamlined digital workflows that pilots actively preferred over the old methods.

## Case Study 4: Financial Services – Previously Uneconomical Portfolio Insights
**Client Context**: An online brokerage wanted to provide retail investors with personalized portfolio insights, but traditional development approaches had ROI challenges due to the complexity of individual customization.  
**Challenge**: Retail investors needed easy-to-understand analytics and alerts tailored to their specific situations, but building individual customization was previously considered too expensive relative to the revenue per user.  
**Workflow Research**: Conducted JTBD research studying how retail traders actually made decisions, analyzed portfolios, and acted on information to understand individual workflow variations.  
**Solution**: Our AI-first approach enabled economically viable individual customization by dramatically reducing development costs. Created dashboard prototypes that adapted to individual trading workflows and validated personalized features with real users at a cost structure that traditional approaches couldn't achieve.  
**Outcome**: Early Operating Capability delivered in 14 weeks with 4-month ROI, contributing to 15% increase in user retention and proving that previously uneconomical personalized features could become profitable through our revolutionary cost structure.

## Case Study 5: SaaS Startup – Workflow-Integrated MVP Validation  
**Client Context**: A funded startup had an idea for a productivity SaaS product but needed to understand how it would integrate into target users' actual work patterns to ensure adoption success.  
**Challenge**: Founders needed validation of both product-market fit and workflow integration before raising their next round, recognizing that great features don't guarantee adoption without proper workflow integration.  
**Workflow Research**: Conducted discovery interviews studying how target users currently solved the problem and mapped existing workflows to identify integration points and potential adoption barriers.  
**Solution**: Designed optimized workflows that integrated the proposed solution seamlessly into users' existing work patterns, built prototypes that demonstrated workflow integration (not just features), and validated both functionality and adoption potential with target users in real work contexts.  
**Outcome**: Startup secured $2M seed funding based on validated MVP concept that included both product validation and demonstrated workflow integration strategy, giving investors confidence in adoption potential beyond just technical feasibility.

## Case Study 6: Small Business – Previously Uneconomical Custom Solution  
**Client Context**: A specialty manufacturing company (50 employees) had a unique inventory tracking problem that didn't fit standard software, but custom development was historically too expensive for their budget.  
**Challenge**: Their specific workflow involved tracking custom components through multiple modification stages with regulatory compliance requirements. Off-the-shelf solutions didn't match their process, and previous quotes for custom software exceeded $200K with 12+ month timelines—economically unfeasible.  
**Workflow Research**: Mapped their complete component lifecycle from initial order through final certification, understanding the specific decision points, compliance requirements, and information flows that made standard solutions inadequate.  
**Solution**: Our AI-first approach enabled a custom solution at revolutionary speed and cost. Designed workflows that maintained their compliance requirements while optimizing efficiency, then built a tailored application that integrated perfectly with their existing processes.  
**Outcome**: Delivered working solution in 8 weeks for under $50K with 6-month ROI through improved efficiency and reduced compliance errors. This "small" problem that was previously uneconomical became a highly successful project, demonstrating how our approach expands the addressable market to include problems traditional development can't justify.**
