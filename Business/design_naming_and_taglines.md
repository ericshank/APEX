## Notes for Design Firm
- Names should balance **economic transformation** with **workflow integration expertise**.  
- Must resonate with executives facing workflow inefficiencies and ROI challenges, not just tech innovators.  
- Taglines should communicate **fundamental economic change** and **seamless workflow integration**.  
- Emphasize **making previously uneconomical solutions viable** through AI-first approach.  
- Highlight **workflow design expertise** and **successful adoption** as key differentiators.  
- Avoid gimmicky or purely technical names—focus on business value and human-centered design.  
- Preference for names that suggest **transformation**, **integration**, and **expanded possibilities**.  
- Global-friendly names that work across industries with workflow challenges.
