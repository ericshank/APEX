## Business Overview
- **Type**: AI Workforce Empowerment Consultancy.  
- **Mission**: Empower organizations to amplify their existing workforce capabilities by integrating AI into workflows. We help companies achieve specific business outcomes—increased productivity, efficiency, capacity, quality, and job satisfaction—by redesigning how people work and creating solutions that support these new workflows.  
- **The Power of "And"**: Unlike consultancies that only recommend OR tech firms that only build, we do BOTH. We analyze workflows AND build solutions AND train people AND create methodologies. We close the loop from concept to measurable business impact through whatever combination of deliverables clients need—concepts, specs, documentation, designs, working products, training programs, or hybrid approaches.  
- **Approach**: Human-centered workflow redesign methodology combining deep UX/human factors expertise with AI-first execution. We iterate continuously, fitting flexibly into client processes while maintaining focus on measurable business outcomes. We get our hands dirty and actually deliver results, not just recommendations.  
- **Founder**: 30+ years experience in product design, product management, prototyping, SaaS development, user experience, usability, and human factors engineering.
