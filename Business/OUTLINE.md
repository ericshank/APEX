Great — this is a strong foundation. To kick things off, here’s how I’d structure the work:

---

## Core Documents to Develop

1. **Company Definition / Vision Document**
   - Purpose and Mission
   - Problem Statement: what problems you help customers solve
   - Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
   - Target Customer Segments
   - Service Offering Overview (Discovery, Research, Prototyping, Implementation)
   - Positioning as "AI First"

2. **Simple Business Plan**
   - Executive Summary
   - Market Opportunity
   - Services and Offerings
   - Go-to-Market Strategy
   - Operating Model (AI agents + expert consultant)
   - Revenue Model
   - Financial Projections (lean to start)
   - Risks and Mitigation

3. **Services & Engagement Model Document**
   - Engagement Phases: Discovery, Design, Prototyping, Validation, Implementation
   - Deliverables by Phase
   - Options for Hand-off vs. Build-out
   - Pricing Models (hourly, project, retainer, success-based)

4. **Capability Deck (for clients)**
   - Your credentials & track record
   - Example domains of expertise (Learning Tech, Drones, Trading, IoT)
   - How you work with AI agents
   - Case study-style scenarios of outcomes

5. **FAQ / Key Questions Document**
   - Common client questions and your answers
   - Framing for AI usage in your process
   - Addressing client concerns about cost, risk, and IP

## Known Inputs (from what you’ve shared)

- **Strengths**: Deep product management & design background, hands-on prototyping, domain expertise in learning tech, drones, trading, IoT, retail, information science.
- **Approach**: Human-led, AI-scaled. Services that span from problem discovery → prototype → validation → pilot → release → sustainment.
- **Differentiator**: "AI First" consultancy that acts as both strategic partner and rapid builder.
- **Market Trends**: Companies are curious about AI but lack in-house expertise to identify practical SaaS opportunities.

## Key Questions to Answer

1. Market Focus:
   - Which industries do we target first? (Learning Tech, Sales Enablement, IoT, etc.)
   - Are we vertical-specific at the start, or broad with a focus on methodology?

2. Engagement Model:
   - Do we lead with a standardized package (e.g., 6-week discovery + prototype) or keep it bespoke?
   - Will we offer ongoing retainers for continuous innovation?

3. Pricing:
   - How do we position pricing relative to design agencies vs. product dev shops vs. consulting firms?
   - Do we tie pricing to milestones or outcomes?

4. Go-to-Market:
   - How do we attract early clients? (network, partnerships, thought leadership, conferences)
   - Do we brand as a solo expert powered by AI, or present as a small firm/team?

5. Capacity & Scale:
   - How many clients can one person + AI effectively serve in parallel?
   - Do we plan to grow with additional human staff, or keep it lean?

I recommend starting with the **Company Definition / Vision Document** and the **Services & Engagement Model**, since those anchor everything else. Then we can sketch the Business Plan with the unknowns framed as questions to validate.

Would you like me to start by drafting the **Company Definition / Vision Document outline** with some content filled in from what you’ve already shared?
